# Code of Conduct 

All Rideau Rollers events are governed by our Code of Conduct. By attending our events you agree to abide by this code. If you have feedback or improvements, email Alysha at alysha@rideaurollers.com.

### Diversity Statement

Rideau Rollers is dedicated to providing a safe and inclusive environment for all event attendees. We do not tolerate discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, gender identity, gender presentation, sexuality, age, religion, socio-economic status, level of skill or skating experience.

### Harassment

Harassment of any form is not tolerated at Rideau Rollers events. This includes:

- rude or insulting language directed at another attendee
- hate speech or slurs
- mis-gendering or deadnaming 
- threats or intimidation
- physical violence
- unwanted sexual attention
 
### Consent 

Before involving another person in any activity, you must ensure you have their enthusiastic consent. This is not a comprehensive list, but some common scenarios when skating where consent is required:

- **Touching or making contact with other attendees**. Whenever you have to physically touch another skater make sure they know what you're going to do and they consent to it.  
- **Taking photos or videos**. Attendees may not be comfortable being recorded.  
- **Tagging or mentioning attendees online**. Attendees may not be comfortable having their location shared publicly.
- **Doing tricks or stunts close to other attendees**. Even if you are confident in your skating ability, make sure to communicate with people nearby so they are aware of your presence and clear of areas where you plan to skate. Remember that other attendees have different levels of comfort on skates. Do not deliberately try to startle or scare other attendees. 
- **Giving feedback**. Make sure people _want_ your advice/feedback. Unsolicited criticism, even if it's well-intentioned, can come across as patronizing or condescending.  

When in doubt, ask. It's better to over-communicate. 

If someone does not consent to something, don't do it. Don't try to coerce them, persuade them or ask for an explanation.

Remember that consent is revocable. If an attendee asks you to stop doing something, stop doing it, even if they previously consented. 

### Report a Violation

If you feel unsafe, or experience harassment or discrimination at a Rideau Rollers event, please report it as soon as possible to Alysha Gardner. This can be in-person or via email (alysha@rideaurollers.com) after the fact.

Reports are strictly confidential. We will not share your identity or details of the report with anyone without your express consent, unless required by law.

If someone is found to be violating the Code of Conduct, remedies may include:

- A warning to stop the harassing or discriminatory behaviour.
- Being removed from an event.
- Being banned from future events.

Repeated violations will result in being banned from future events.
