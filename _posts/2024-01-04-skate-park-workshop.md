Steph "Shots" Salazar is back for another round of skate park lessons at [The Yard](https://theyardottawa.com/) indoor skate park on Saturday, February 10!

Based on feedback from the last session we've planned things a little differently: each workshop is an hour long with smaller groups (10 skaters versus 15 last time). There's also 2 different Street workshops - one for skaters with little or no park experience, and one for skaters who have visited a park but want to level up. Hopefully this means everyone gets more specific feedback on the stuff they want to perfect!

On top of your lesson, you also get access to the whole skate park from 7-10PM! This will give everyone time to practice before/after their lesson to get most out of their time with Steph.

We'll also be hosting an after-party at [Ten Toes Coffee House & Laundry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3wcdPu1GhQRarZ6x8) on Somerset St. They have beer, wine, treats, and they've offered to make some vegetarian pizza for us as well! It's a short walk or drive from the venue.
