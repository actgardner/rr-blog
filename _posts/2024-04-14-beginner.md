Buying your first pair of roller skates can be daunting! 
As the weather warms up we break down some things to consider and make some recommendations.

### What kind of skating?

The first question to ask yourself is: what do you want to do with your skates? 

Some possible options:

- Playing roller derby
- Skating on bike paths
- Dancing outdoors
- Aggressive quad skating (skate park)
- Dancing and cruising at the roller rink

### Heeled or flat? 

Heeled skates move your center of gravity forwards, so you can stand up more naturally. They're used for artistic skating, and they're popular for outdoor skating and rink skating.

Flat skates work best in an athletic position with your knees bent. They're required for roller derby, and they're popular for speed skating and some dance styles.
