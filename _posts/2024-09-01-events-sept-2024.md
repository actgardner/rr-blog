### Roll-Out - Sunday September 15 

Join us for a morning trail skate along some smooth bike paths! Meet at 10AM at Pimisi Station.

The route will be along the bike path from Pimisi Station on Booth St to Bayview Station. We'll continue south along the bike path along the train tracks to Gladstone, or possibly all the way to Dow's Lake (depending on how people are feeling). Nobody will be left behind, and there will be someone there to help new trail skaters! 

RSVP to the FB event or watch our Instagram for updates - we will post in advance if we need to cancel due to bad weather.

Free to attend. All wheels are welcome (inlines, longboards, etc). You should be able to skate safely and stay in control outdoors. *Helmets and pads strongly recommended.*
