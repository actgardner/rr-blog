To celebrate Pride this year we asked Ottawa Valley Roller Derby (OVRD) skaters _Red Headed for Trouble_ and _Beef Baby_ what roller derby means to them as queer skaters.

_Red Headed for Trouble_

When I joined roller derby at 14, I was many years from coming to terms with being queer, let alone realizing I wasn’t straight. Becoming interested in the sport after watching Elliot Page in Whip It! could have been a clue but compulsory heterosexuality meant that it took years to figure out that my attraction to all genders was real and legitimate. Being part of a community where queerness isn’t just embraced but is actually the norm played a HUGE role in me discovering who I was and being comfortable expressing that.

To me, roller derby means community care and solidarity. It means being physically active out of a love for the sport and for myself, not as a way to conform to beauty standards. It means working together to uplift others and remove barriers to accessing sport and community. 

Roller derby is so much more than a sport where queer and trans people are welcome. Queerness is a fundamental element of roller derby and the sport would literally not exist without the hard work and passion of the queer and trans people in it. I am eternally grateful to all the queer and trans skaters who have mentored me and been my friends over the years. They have made my life so full and beautifully queer.

_Beef Baby_

The most beautiful experience of my life is being a part of the roller derby community at OVRD. It is really incredible to be a part of a community where you can be cherished, challenged, and supported while you discover yourself. 

I grew up extremely closeted and came out a year ago. My coming out was directly supported by the friendships I made and the queerness of the community in general. Queer friendship is magic and allowed me the space to honour who I am. 

There is a moment from our last game that stands out to me, our team was walking out to warm up and I am at the back, watching the team walk and chat together. I had this moment of "this is my team", and it really hit me with how unique and special that experience is, to be a part of a team with so many other queer and trans skaters, where you can be wholly yourself. 

It is so much more than a sport. In roller derby I have become a part of the community I have always yearned for.
