### Roll-Out - Sunday October 6 

Join us for a morning trail skate along some smooth bike paths! Meet at 10AM at Pimisi Station.

The route will be along the bike path from Pimisi Station on Booth St to Bayview Station. We'll continue south along the bike path along the train tracks to Gladstone, or possibly all the way to Dow's Lake (depending on how people are feeling). Nobody will be left behind, and there will be someone there to help new trail skaters! 

RSVP to the FB event or watch our Instagram for updates - we will post in advance if we need to cancel due to bad weather.

Free to attend. All wheels are welcome (inlines, longboards, etc). You should be able to skate safely and stay in control outdoors. *Helmets and pads strongly recommended.*

### City of Ottawa - Jim Tubman Chevrolet Rink 

The Jim Tubman Chevrolet Rink is a covered outdoor skating rink with a smooth concrete surface. At some point in October they will start installing ice, but for now there's lots of drop-in skating opportunities!

### City of Ottawa - Lansdowne 

The City of Ottawa hosts low-cost skate sessions at Lansdowne all year-round. These are usually in the Hosticulture Building where the floor is polished concrete and can be slippery. Sometimes they may be moved to the Aberdeen Pavillion or cancelled if there are other events taking place at Lansdowne.

There are two sessions on Tuesdays: 6:15 and 7:20PM. Itâ€™s not necessary to book in advance but we recommend checking the City website for any changes to the schedule.
